CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

## Why Use CSS?

CSS is used to separate the content of a web page from its design and layout. This separation improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enables multiple pages to share formatting, and reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.

## Basic Syntax

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
